In the following screen, you have access to multiple settings.

A workbench includes the following components:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the workbench.
- **Compute Configuration**: Allows users to select the appropriate amount of computational resources based on their requirements.
- **Storage**: Defines the type and size of storage for data and programs.
- **Mounting Folder**: Specifies the path used to access the defined storage.
- **Home Folder** (optional): Provides a shared location for settings and configurations across multiple workbenches.

Name the new workbench **SASInnovate2025**.

Choose **2 cores, 8GiB RAM** (the smallest configuration) for the compute size.

Choose the default **myfolder** storage definition and default **myfolder** mounting folder.

No **home folder** will be needed for this hands-on.
